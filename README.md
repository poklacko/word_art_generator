# word_art_generator

This JavaScript code creates unique "word art" from a given word using ASCII characters. 
<br>
The stringArt() function takes a word and generates a four-row pattern: a top row, a middle row, a mirrored version of the middle row, and a mirrored version of the top row. 
<br>
The pattern is always the same size, no matter how long the word is.
